A simple stratego game made with Java

Uploading stratego_gameplay.mp4…

Made a Stratego game from scratch with Java. You can click each piece to reveal the available squares the clicked piece can go to. You can also attack the other player's pieces. The attacking phase works like this: Each piece has a number indicating his rank. The higher the rank, the more powerful the piece. When a higher rank piece attacks a lower rank piece, the second dies and dissappears from the map. Also some pieces have special abilities such as moving more squares or attacking higher ranked pieces. The winner is decided when the other player's flag has been captured.
